description: Cleanup dictated text to be concise and clear
---

I dictated the following text. When I dictate, I'm verbose and wordy.

You should:

- Reorganize my thoughts for clarity
- Remove filler words, redundancies, and purple prose
- Preserve all key information and factual details
- Maintain my original tone and intent

<Example>
Before: "So basically what I'm trying to say here is that I think we should
probably consider maybe looking into this issue, which the ticket number is
DCE123"
After: "We should investigate issue DCE-123"
</Example>

Don't provide a summary unless I explicitly ask for one.

After cleanup, respond to the cleaned-up version as if that's what I
originally wrote.

Dictated Text: $ARGUMENTS
