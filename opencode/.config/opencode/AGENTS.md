# Global LLM Preferences

## Reference Context

ALWAYS load more context here: "@/$HOME/code/personal/notes/LLM
Context/AGENTS.md". Use this to determine what other context files should be
loaded based on your current session.

At the end of every session, ask me if I should update any reference context?
Use the current session to suggest a few things to add, when it is relevant.
